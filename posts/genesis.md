The start of a fool's story.

What I truly do not understand is why there is this 'hate' of rich white people. I am apparently somewhat thrown into this category, but I do not understand why. I'm white, but I am not rich. I choose to spend money on things I enjoy doing rather than buying a lot of small things that hold no value to me.

What would _you_ do if you were given $100,000,000 from a billionaire? Would you give it back to the billionaire? The person you hate so much? Would you burn the money? Would you save it for your children, nieces/nephews? Your family? I would keep it and allocate where I felt it would make the most impact to better society as a whole. Each person should feel the same way.

**You** are the best person to decide what to do with any wealth or currency you acquire! If you see problems in the world we live in, you should fix them. If you see an opportunity to help people who are less fortunate that are deserving (in your opinion), then you should use what has been given to you to help these people. It's very simple. People say they want real change...but nobody wants the responsibility of making this change. They allow the richest of the rich to choose what is best for us. If you want to be free from that kind of control, you should strive to impact the world in the best way you see fit.
