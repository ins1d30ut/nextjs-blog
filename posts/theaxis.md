"One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane. Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born. My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration."
-Nikola Tesla

Nikola Tesla also said "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."

Music is a form of communication. It transmits feeling, emotion, meaning, and ideas. It can be a way for an artist to share an experience, and I do think that Jimi Hendrix was clearly sharing his experiences in a great deal of his music.

Are you Experienced?

'Bold as Love' - The Axis is 'everything'. It is 'God'. _You_ are The Axis. It holds all of the answers and knows absolute truth. Listening to Bold as Love earlier tonight took me on a quick journey inward and allowed me to become what we all are...'receivers' of information that is stored throughout the Universe. We are all pyramids with an antenna positioned at the top that is constantly receiving information through energy, frequency and vibration. The message I received was pretty straightforward: "You know you are on the right path right now. Had you not experienced all of the lowest lows, you would not appreciate or even be able to recognize what can and will lead to the highest highs in the next chapter of your life. Be bold. Be sure. Be strong." This is what I was led to while listening to 'Bold as Love'.

The **BIG SECRET** is knowing how to receive this information and find truth - "knowledge, strength and inspiration". Tesla said "be alone". To me, this means taking time to sit and meditate after setting some sort of intention or goal beforehand. Slow your thoughts down, lose yourself in the nothingness of space, and enter the 'astral plane'. Doing this will allow you to find answers to anything and everything. When you actualy achieve this state of being (which is your consciousness breaking away from your perceived self) you become the Universe...The Axis. There are no limits. Consciousness is constantly expanding and it is the Universe.

I was told fairly recently to start trusting my gut and following whatever path it leads me to. Your gut is not listening to all of the distracting thoughts that are a product of feeling like we are in this limited 3 dimensional world. Your gut is an innate energy that we all have and is a compass that can guide us while living in our current reality, but we have to let it. In order to do that, we have to let go. We have to break ourselves out of this small way of thinking and living. We can build whatever we want...we can manifest whatever we want in this reality. We are creators. We are actually 'The Creator' of our own realities, but at some point in our lives, we were taught certain rules are and that we are supposed to follow these rules. We start off as children...we have imaginary friends, build our own games with our own rules. We are curious. We ask questions and wonder how or why things work. We create.

Nothing is more important than nurturing a child and encouraging our children to keep creating things, questioning and exploring things. There are certain values we should encourage that are as simple as being a good person and to not intentionally hurt others, but the 'rules' of _The Universe_ are not so rigid. If we were created in God's image, that literally means that we are a 'copy' of God. We are all 'The Creator'.

So I met The Axis. He knows everything. I am creating exactly what I want my world to be. I can invite whoever I want into my world and I can choose to keep others out. Terrence McKenna said that he believed that allowing another person to enter your reality and to be able to see it exactly as you see it is the most intimate thing a person can possibly share. He was talking about virtual reality when he said this, but the point remains the same and the truth is we don't need virtual reality to bring someone else into your own reality and let them see what you see. I would have to agree with him on that.

I'll end this little 'journal entry' with one of my favorite song lyrics of all time.
